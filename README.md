## Conclusion
After pragmatically not being able to keep track of the words learnt per day to improve my vocabulary for GRE exams , let alone have an idea of whether there was a consistent growth in my arsenal of words.

Then this script was developed  to come save the day, now all it takes is just one command to literally save me from dashing into ineffectiveness and instead speed up the highway of productivity.
